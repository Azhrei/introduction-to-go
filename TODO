Is there an older version of src/katas/input/* without all of the code
written?

Add setup of Git, Go present, and the slides to the Setup Guide.

Advertise as "Similar to Go Tutorial but takes things deeper."

Mention the use of:
    import m "lib/math"
    ...and...
    import . "lib/math"

Need new description of Slices and make():
    Suggest covering the basics of arrays first, then a little bit about
    slices.  A later section should revisit slices and demonstrate
    operations like append() and cap().

Be more "idiomatic".  (Not idiotic. :))
