1.  The Go programming language is dynamically typed like JavaScript
and Python, or statically typed like Java and C++.
    A.  Dynamically, like JS and Python
    B.  Statically, like Java and C++

2.  Arrays in Java are bounds-checked, but arrays in C++ are not.  The
Go language DOES do bounds checking for slices and arrays.
    A.  True
    B.  False

3.  Java guarantees that variables are initialized to zero, C++
does not.  The Go language guarantees that all variables are
initialized to zero.
    A.  True
    B.  False

4.  Does this code compile?  If not, what is the error message?
(You can send it to me in a private chat!)

    package main

    func main() {
        nums := []int { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, }
        println(nums)
    }

5.  Given the following statements, what does the output look like?
(You can send it to me in a private chat!)

    package main

    func main() {
        primes := []int { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, }
        println(primes[2:5])
    }
